== Description ==

A plug-and-play Gutenberg block plugin for WordPress that lets you add beautiful, accessible, and SEO-optimized FAQ accordions anywhere on your site.  
Zero configuration, modern design presets, FAQ schema support, and perfect theme compatibility.

= Features =

* **Add Accordion FAQs Anywhere:**  
  Instantly add a question and answer (rich content) using a single, reusable block.  
  Supports patterns and block templates for efficient workflows.

* **Rich Content Support:**  
  Use any block (text, images, lists, embeds) in the answer area. No limits.

* **SEO-Ready with FAQ Schema:**  
  Outputs valid FAQPage JSON-LD schema for all visible accordions.  
  Auto-detects major SEO plugins (Yoast SEO, RankMath, AIOSEO) for seamless integration and prevents duplicate schema.

* **Accessible & Keyboard-Friendly:**  
  Built on the WAI-ARIA Accordion Pattern.  
  Full keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance out of the box.

* **Modern Design Presets:**  
  Choose from a variety of built-in style presets, including a default matching the WordPress Design System (WPDS).  
  Optionally disable plugin CSS to let your theme fully control styling.

* **Custom Icons:**  
  Select icon (chevron, arrow, plus/minus, etc.) and its position (before/after) for each accordion item.  
  All icons are lightweight SVG and extendable.

* **Performance First:**  
  No frontend JS or CSS loaded unless the block is present on the page.  
  Pure CSS animation for open/closeâ€”no jQuery, no bloat.

* **Developer-Friendly:**  
  Modular, extensible code with PSR-4 autoloading and PHP namespaces.  
  Built using @wordpress/scripts for fast, modern development.
